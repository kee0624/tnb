              <h2>Power plants are the backbone of Malaysia’s energy system, operating behind the scenes ensuring that homes remain lit, businesses stay productive, and essential public services continue to function.</h2>

              <p>
                As the nation’s demand for electricity rises, these facilities must operate at optimal efficiency and reliability, minimizing disruptions while supporting Malaysia’s transition to a more sustainable energy future.<br/><br/>

                Inside every plant is a system with a process that transform different energy sources - whether it is hydro, natural gas or renewable energy - being converted into electricity that powers daily life. In thermal plants, for example, water is heated to produce high-pressure steam, which spins turbines and drives generators that feed into the national grid.<br/><br/>

                This process relies on countless components, each playing a critical role. Among the most important are steam valves, which regulate the flow and pressure of steam within turbines. As is the case with any machinery, these valves are subjected to extreme temperatures and pressure which can become prone to wear and tear. Even with regular maintenance, these items can deteriorate over time, with leaks and other issues developing.

              <h3>Every Drop Counts, Efficiency with Purpose</h3>
              <p>
                With the right oversight and continuous improvements, power plants can operate at peak efficiency - ensuring that every drop of water and every unit of fuel is used purposefully to generate the electricity we depend on.<br/><br/>

                Even the smallest components, such as steam valves, play a vital role in this process. When well-maintained, they help plants run smoothly, reducing resource consumption, optimizing performance, and keeping operating costs under control. Efficient operations will lead to lower water and fuel consumptions, which translates into a reduced carbon footprint and a lighter impact on the climate.<br/><br/>

                At Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB), we have the responsibility to address potential and actual steam leaks not just for maximum operational efficiency but to also make sure that it doesn’t use unnecessary amounts of natural resources. Water is a precious resource, and making sure that it is used with care and purpose is in line with the company’s broader environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals.

                During the series of maintenance outages, the teams also identified leaks in the high pressure drain piping. Samples were sent for lab analysis, which confirmed that the failures were caused by high-temperature wear and degradation over time. To address this, the original piping was replaced with the material which offers superior resistance to high temperatures and extends the service life of the high pressure drain system.
