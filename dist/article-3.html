              <h2 id="overview">Gender diversity in Malaysia's corporate sector is more important and visible today than ever before. Across the board, companies are realising the importance of having more women in senior leadership and decision-making roles.</h2>

              <p>
                Having more women in a corporation's top levels has become a key indicator of good governance, sustainability, and long-term business resilience. In line with national aspirations and global ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) targets, many large Malaysian companies are committed to make sure that women are better represented across all levels of their organisations.<br/><br/>

                Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB), Malaysia’s largest electricity utility company, has taken a proactive step in this area, with a meaningful adoption of women's voices in corporate governance, reflecting an approach that goes beyond mere formality.

              <h3 id="heading1">The Challenges of Balancing Gender in Corporate Malaysia</h3>
              <p>
                The journey towards greater gender diversity in Malaysian corporate leadership has been shaped by clear initiatives, most notably through the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance (MCCG), introduced by the Securities Commission in 2000.<br/><br/>

                This Code has served as a foundational guideline for corporate governance, encouraging companies to adopt industry best practices in board composition. A pivotal enhancement came in 2012, when the Code recommended that public-listed companies (PLCs) aim for 30% female representation at the board level. This recommendation was further strengthened in 2021 to include all PLCs, followed by a mandatory requirement by Bursa Malaysia in June 2023 for each listed company to appoint at least one female director.<br/><br/>

                This reinforces the point that gender diversity is not simply a social goal but a competitive advantage that can drive better governance, innovation, and overall business performance.
              </p>

              <h3 id="heading2">TNB's Commitment to Levelling out the Gender Field</h3>
              <p>
                At TNB, we recognize that gender diversity in leadership is a cornerstone of a resilient, innovative, and future-ready organization. As part of our ESG commitments and in alignment with national aspirations, we are actively advancing the representation of women in decision-making roles across the company.
                TNB is aligned with Malaysia’s 30% target for women in senior leadership positions, a goal endorsed by the Government. We view this not as a quota, but as a critical mass that ensures women’s perspectives are embedded meaningfully in corporate strategy, governance and growth. In TNB, women’s advancement is based on merit, excellent performance, proven success, leadership capability and credibility.<br/><br/>

                By 2022, the company surpassed the national target of having 30% women representation on its Board. In alignment with this progress, the company is also working towards achieving a 30% target for women in senior management positions, with current representation standing at 26% across the Group.<br/><br/>
